# 📊 Trader-Dashboard
A Dashboard for (Day)Traders to track performance and spot anomalies. ⭐
This makes trade data visual and easy to understand, helps finding patterns and aids in future decision making.

## 📃 Criteria/Wants
The goal for this project is to create an easy to understand dashboard for forward- and back-tested data.
To accomplish this I desire the following functionalities:
- Performance charts based on profit and loss data
- Different KPI's that can be set, for example: risk to reward, stoploss sizes and winrates
- Means and common results in a brief reflection description
- Advice based on KPI's when they are or aren't met
- Optional connection to a trade account, so data does not have to be manually imported

## 🛠️ Tools and Applications used:
### Data Gathering/Cleaning
- Python 
- SQL
### Data Visualization
- Power BI
